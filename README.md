# disappearing-achievements

This is a proficiency demonstration for JavaScript requested by CodeFellows.
The project name refers to the fact that the exercise specified that "To-do
items should disappear when clicked on". That is *not* the behavior I would
have chosen, as it deprives the user of the satisfaction of seeing to-do items
crossed out when completed.
